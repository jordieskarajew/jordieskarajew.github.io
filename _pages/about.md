I am a final-year Bachelor of Science student with a specialisation in Pure Mathematics at the University of Melbourne. My academic interests lie in algebra, probability, and stochastic processes, with a particular curiosity about how these areas intersect. I am broadly interested in using mathematical thinking to investigate complex systems governed by randomness and uncertainty.
